Challenges & Learning Experience

I primarily work with MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), but today, I explored Golang and Next.js for the first time. It was an exciting experience, and I learned a lot while working on this project.

I hope I qualify for the next round! üöÄ I'm really excited about the opportunity to work at Zocket! üòÉ
